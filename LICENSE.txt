Totaly Real License

Copyright 2025 Fightingpainter (idk if this means anything, I just saw other Licenses having this)

I own this code.

You can do whatever you want with it — copy it, modify it, use it, sell it — whatever.

Just don't claim it as your own and then try to sue me (or anyone else) for using "your" version.
If that happens, you owe me 100 GadillionBAdillion Million Dollars... or some other ridiculous amount.
(Not really. Just don’t sue people over code that wasn’t yours in the first place.)

You can relicense it if you want, but you do so at your own risk. 
I’m not responsible for anything that happens if you use or share this code.

Basically, I don't care about legal stuff, just be nice please.
